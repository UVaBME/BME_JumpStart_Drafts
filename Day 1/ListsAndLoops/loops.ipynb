    "To this point, we have focused on variables holding a single value or operations performed only once. But, what if we have many values that we want to store or many operations that we want to perform? This is where lists and loops come in. In this module, we will learn how to harness the power of lists and loops to make our code more efficient and powerful.\n",

    "1. Learn the purpose of lists, how to create one, and how to manipulate them.\n",
    "2. __Learn how to use loops to repeat operations, including how to use loops to iterate through lists. There are two main types of loops we will discuss:__\n",

Let's say we have a list of length measurements in micrometers that we need to convert to meters. We could do this like this:"

    "Hmm, the list appears unchanged. Why might that be? Let's briefly talk about what is happening under the hood here. When our `measurements` list was used in the `for` clause, it was converted into an interator, the first element of the list was *copied* into the `item` variable. It is no longer associated with our list. If we want to change the list, we need to explicitly do so within the for loop. To do this, we need to make use of the built-in `enumerate()` function, which will copy both the index and the value of the item in the list at that index for each iteration.
