# List, Loops, and Vectorization Lesson Plan

Below is the current outline of lesson 3, and the approximate times estimated. The goal is to aim for the low end of timings, allowing for ~5 minutes of total buffer time. The total lesson time is 40 minutes.

1. Lists (18 minutes)
    1. Creating and accessing lists (6 minutes)
        1. Introducing the concept (2 minutes)
        2. Exercise (4 minutes - 2 minutes to work, 2 minutes to discuss)
    2. Nested Loops and Multidimensional matrices (6 minutes)
        1. Introducing the concept (2 minutes)
        2. Exercise (4 minutes - 2 minutes to work, 2 minutes to discuss)
    3. Editing Lists (5 minutes)
        1. Introducing the concept (2 minutes)
        2. Exercise (3 min - 2 min to work, 1 min to discuss)
    4. List-like objects (2 minutes)
2. Loops (15-20 minutes)
    1. `for` loops (10 minutes)
        1. Introduce the concept (5 minutes)
        2. Exercise (5 minutes - 3 minutes to work, 2 minutes to discuss)
    2. `while` loops (5 minutes)
        1. Introduce (2 minutes)
        2. Exercise (3 minutes - 2 minutes to work, 1 minute to discuss)
3. Numpy and Vectorization (2-5 minutes, depending on remaining time)
