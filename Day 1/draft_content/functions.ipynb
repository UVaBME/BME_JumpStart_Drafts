If we're doing some bioinformatics, we might use these functions over and over again. We should therefore thoroughly **test** the functions. For example, we should test that `reverse_complement('GCAGTTGCA')` returns `'TGCAACTGC'`. For now, we will proceed without writing tests, but we will soon cover **test-driven development**, in which your functions are built around tests. For now, I will tell you this: **If your functions are not thoroughly tested, you are entering a world of pain. A world of pain.** Test your functions."
